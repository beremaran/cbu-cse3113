Print 'circle' object before next code block. Values exceeds 8-bit unsigned
integer limits, called 'overflow', So we need to map (normalize) values of
`circle` matrix to range of:

    [0, 256)

We shall use `min-max normalization` procedure to map values that causing
overflows. `min-max normalization` procedure defined where upper-limit of target
range is 255 as

    p' = 255 * (p - min(I)) / (max(I) - min(I))

where I is image array, p is intensity of arbitraty pixel from image I and
p' is the normalized pixel intensity.

circle = 255 * (circle - circle.min()) / (circle.max() - circle.min())
# ==

# Set the intensity values
for x in range(img.shape[0]):
    for y in range(img.shape[1]):
        intensity = circle[x][y]
        img[x][y] = intensity

# Display Image directly from buffer
Image.fromarray(img, 'L').show()

# Save Ä±mage directly from buffer
Image.fromarray(img, 'L').save('circle-bad.png', 'PNG')
