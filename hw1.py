# Create an empty image
img = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.uint8)

# Create [x, y] coordinate combinations on grid
xx, yy = np.mgrid[:height, :width]

    Print 'circle' object before next code block. Values exceeds 8-bit unsigned
integer limits, called 'overflow', So we need to map (normalize) values of
`circle` matrix to range of:
    [0, 256)

## Simple example for normalizing
(assuming both of ranges have a start value of 0)

    MAPPED_VALUE = VALUE * (TARGET_RANGE_MAX / CURRENT_RANGE_MAX)

Let's say that we want to map "6" from [0, 10] to [0, 100]:

    x = 6 * (100 / 10)
    x = 60

If source or target range is not starting from zero, check map() function from
Arduino libraries:

'''

circle *= 255.0 / circle.max()
# ==

# Set the intensity values
for x in range(img.shape[0]):
    for y in range(img.shape[1]):
        intensity = circle[x][y]
        img[x][y] = intensity

# Display Image directly from buffer
Image.fromarray(img, 'L').show()

# Save Ä±mage directly from buffer
Image.fromarray(img, 'L').save('circle-bad.png', 'PNG')
